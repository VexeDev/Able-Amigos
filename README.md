Players use orbs they collect in the level to grow. This then allows them to reach buttons or other interactables they couldn't before.<br/>

In addition, players can throw/share orbs with each other, adding to collaborative elements. <br/>

Throughout some levels, there are also hazards for the players to avoid, such as acidic goop. <br/>

Ultimately, the goal is for players to collect a key, which then opens the door for them to escape. <br/>
